# Nightingale 30 Days Challenge


## 1. Intro

The #30diasdegráficos challenge was a proposal done by [R4DS_es](https://twitter.com/R4DS_es) with two main objectives: one to motivate the latin R-community to show up their abilities in terms of graphics; and the second objective to commemorate the 200 years birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale (12th May 1820).

[Florence Nightingale](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) was a nurse during Crimea War (October 1853-February 1856). She, together with  38 other volunteer nurses, went to the first-row line at the Scutari base. There they found out that mainly all injured where treated incorrectly by an overwhelmed medical team.
They were in totally shortage of medical instruments, medicine, etc.
Thanks to her indications and ideas, her manage to decrease the mortality rates using techniques as cleaning pollutants containers or opening the windows.

But she was not only an incredible nurse, but also a mathematician and statistician. She is mainly recognized because of her "Diagram of the causes of mortality". A polar coordinate chart that is showing the different causes of mortality from April 1854 to March 1855 in a very intuitive manner.

At 1858 she was announced as a member of the Royal Statistical Society, being the first woman to get that role.
