# My Tailor's Drawer 🔨


## 1. Main objective 💡

The aim of this repo is to serve as my own "tailor's drawer". All projects that I have started and build will be summarized in their own folder.

This repo will not solve any specific question, but it will be a disorganized way of presenting multiple attempts of solving different issues in different languages.

You can find, below, the list of projects that you will find here.
